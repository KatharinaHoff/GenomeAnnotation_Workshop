    "Repetitive sequences are a huge problem for genome annotation. Some repeats only coincidentally look like protein-coding genes, others (such as transposases) are protein-coding genes, but we usually are not interested in any of these \"repeat genes\" when trying to find protein-coding genes in a novel genome. Thus, a genome should be repeat-masked prior gene prediction. \n",

    "Repeat masking is a resource and time-consuming step that is out of scope for this workshop. We recommend using RepeatModeler2 ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921046117), [software](https://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/) ) to construct a species-specific repeat library and mask the genome with RepeatMasker (ideally, you will perform these computations on a node with >70 threads, in a place with very fast storage i/o, possibly using RAM instead of actual hard drive as a temporary file storage place):\n",

    "## ⛵ Annotation of protein coding genes\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural genome annotation is ideally performed by a combination of a statistical model (e.g. Hidden Markov Model derivate) and extrinsic evidence (e.g. from transcriptomics or known protein sequences). The statistical model parameters have to be adapted to the genomic properties of novel species. For adapting parameters, an initial set of high-quality training genes from the target species is required. This is tricky to obtain. BRAKER is a perl script that comprises several pipelines to automated the solution of this problem: fully automatically generate an initial set of training genes, train gene finders, and then predict genes with the trained parameters and extrinsic evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first take an approach to structural genome annotation that takes advantage both of RNA-Seq data, and a large database of known proteins, using BRAKER3 ([poster from PAG2023](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lars-Gabriel-3/publication/367409816_The_BRAKER3_Genome_Annotation_Pipeline/links/63d14cbae922c50e99c29c7a/The-BRAKER3-Genome-Annotation-Pipeline.pdf), [software](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER)). If sufficient transcriptome data is available, then BRAKER3 is usually the best choice of pipeline. However, in the lack of transcriptome data, we need to consider alternative approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "If transcriptome evidence is available but it just was not sufficient for obtaining good results with BRAKER3, then protein supported gene prediction with BRAKER2 ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa108)) is often a good option.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the total absence of transcriptome data, we recommend running either BRAKER2 with a large database of proteins, alone, or for larger genomes (such as vertebrates), we recommend the application of GALBA ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.10.536199v1.abstract), [software](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/GALBA)) with reference proteomes of a few closely related, already annotated species.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ab initio gene prediction using deep learning, Tiberius ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae685), [software](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Tiberius)) provides a modern alternative that does not require species-specific training data."

    "### 🚣 I have 80.000 genes predicted by BRAKER/TSEBRA in a full genome, what shall I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please first check whether you are referring to genes, or to transcripts. BRAKER predicts alternative isoforms. If RNA-Seq data supports this, the number of alternative transcripts may be large, but likely true. If it's really genes that you counted, then 80.000 sounds way too much, indeed (unless you are dealing with a genome that has multiple copies of each chromosome). Most likely, GeneMark-ET/ES/EP/ETP produced highly fragmented training genes for AUGUSTUS. This will also lead to highly fragmented genes predicted by AUGUSTUS. First, check whether your genome has been masked for repeats. Consider using the additional TRF masking desribed at the top of this notebook. If that does not help, and if you have a protein set of closely related species at hand, consider using that protein set as sole training data for AUGUSTUS. You can use GALBA for this (https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/GALBA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚣 I have only 10.000 genes predicted by BRAKER/TSEBRA in a full genome, what shall I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Check whether the BRAKER output files in subfolders Augustus and GeneMark-* produced more genes than TSEBRA. By default, TSEBRA will discard genes without evidence. If you have only little evidence for your species, TSEBRA might be a bad idea. You can also try rerunning TSEBRA with enforcing one of the gene sets.  There are also species for which is \"normal\" to observe less than 10,000 genes, check the annotated relatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚣 How do I know how many genes to expect?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard to say. You can download gene sets of related species e.g. from NCBI Genomes, and count. Some gene sets tend to be \"underannotated\", i.e. they may represent rather the lower numbers of what might be realistic. Katharina usually gets nervous about more than 45000 genes and fewer than 15000 genes. These are definitely weird gene counts - but as stated before, there are cases where these are totally fine, too. Otherwise: always inspect your gene set in a Genome Browser such as the UCSC Genome Browser to identify problems.\n",
