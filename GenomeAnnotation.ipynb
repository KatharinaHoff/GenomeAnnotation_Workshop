    "\n",
    "Repetitive sequences are a huge problem for genome annotation with classical methods, such as BRAKER and Galba (not so problematic with deep learning methods such as Tiberius, even if trained on a repeat masked genome, it may perform ok on an unmasked or poorly masked genome during inference). Some repeats only coincidentally look like protein-coding genes, others (such as transposases) are protein-coding genes, but we usually are not interested in any of these \"repeat genes\" when trying to find protein-coding genes in a novel genome. Thus, a genome should be repeat-masked prior to gene prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat masking is a resource and time-consuming step that is out of scope for this workshop. If you plan on using BRAKER or Galba for genome annotation, or want to use a Tiberius model that was trained for softmasked genomes, we recommend using RepeatModeler2 ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921046117), [software](https://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/) ) to construct a species-specific repeat library and mask the genome with RepeatMasker (ideally, you will perform these computations on a node with >70 threads, in a place with very fast storage i/o, possibly using RAM instead of actual hard drive as a temporary file storage place):\n",

BRAKER predicts alternative isoforms. If RNA-Seq data supports this, the number of alternative transcripts may be large, but likely true. Tiberius *ab initio* predicts only one isoform, but with evidence, also alternative transcripts. If it's really genes that you counted, then 80.000 sounds way too much, indeed (unless you are dealing with a genome that has multiple copies of each chromosome). In BRAKER, most likely, GeneMark-ET/ES/EP/ETP produced highly fragmented training genes for AUGUSTUS. This will also lead to highly fragmented genes predicted by AUGUSTUS. First, check whether your genome has been masked for repeats. Consider using the additional TRF masking desribed at the top of this notebook. If that does not help, and if you have a protein set of closely related species at hand, consider using that protein set as sole training data for AUGUSTUS. You can use GALBA for this (https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/GALBA). If Tiberius caused the issue, try running BRAKER3, instead.\n\n### 🚣 I have only 10.000 genes predicted by BRAKER/TSEBRA in a full genome, what shall I do?\n\nCheck whether the BRAKER output files in subfolders Augustus and GeneMark-* produced more genes than TSEBRA. By default, TSEBRA will discard genes without evidence. If you have only little evidence for your species, TSEBRA might be a bad idea. You can also try rerunning TSEBRA with enforcing one of the gene sets.  There are also species for which is \"normal\" to observe less than 10,000 genes, check the annotated relatives.\n\n### 🚣 How do I know how many genes to expect?\n\nHard to say. You can download gene sets of related species e.g. from NCBI Genomes, and count. Some gene sets tend to be \"underannotated\", i.e. they may represent rather the lower numbers of what might be realistic. Katharina usually gets nervous about more than 45000 genes and fewer than 15000 genes. These are definitely weird gene counts - but as stated before, there are cases where these are totally fine, too. Otherwise: always inspect your gene set in a Genome Browser such as the UCSC Genome Browser to identify problems.\n\n### 🚣 I have long isoseq RNA-Seq transcripts, can I put them into BRAKER?\n\nYes, you find a dedicated container and instructions on the poster from PAG 2024 at https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER/blob/master/docs/posters/poster_PAG2024.pdf . Note: this works with only isoseq data, not with mixed short- and long reads. If you have both data types, you could run it once with long reads, once with short reads, and then combine the results with TSEBRA.\n\nThe Tiberius evidence integration pipeline natively supports the combination of isoseq and rnaseq.\n\n### 🚣 I opened an issue on GitHub about BRAKER, Tiberius or TSEBRA 100 days ago, nobody replied, why?\n\nWe are a small team of developers. We try our best and usually respond to well described and easy-to-solve issues within a rather short time frame. Solving other issues may take considerable amounts of time that we simply do not have, or they may be described in a way that we don't know what do with them... please be patient with us. We are at this point in time not bugfixing BRAKER, anymore. Consider using Tiberius if you can.\n\n### ⛵ I have a problem, whom do I tell?\n\nPlease read through the Issues on Github. If the issue does not exist, yet, open an issue.\n\n# ⛵ Ready to move on?\n\nIf you feel confident about your skills, take them to the next level. We have prepared chromosome 4 of a small genome in the following notebook: [Annotate_Babesia_duncani.ipynb](Annotate_Babesia_duncani.ipynb). The task is designed such that you will not complete all tasks during today's session. Instead, you will be randomly assigned with a sub-task, and we will merge the results of everyone who participates to gain a final overview of the results.\n\n### The End"
